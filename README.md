# lunar-eclipse
A Manim animation created to visualize the Earth-Sun-Moon system and how lunar eclipses happen by Bahaa Sharaf.

This was written in Python using the Manim library. See [Manim Documentation](https://docs.manim.community) for more info and how to download.

Neither the moon, earth, and the sun's sizes, orbits, and distances nor the rotation of the moon and the earth are drawn/animated to scale. This is becase this animation was only made to illutrate the idea of why we don't get lunar eclipses everytime the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon. Also, the sun light rays are supposed to be drawn parallel and not like the animation since the sun is so far away all the lines that come are practically parallel however, they were drawn this way to illustrate the umbra and the penumbra of the earth.
